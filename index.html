        <p class="para">My hobby is coding. To do my freetime coding I have to finish my coding homework early. I create my own projects when I am done,I even created a pomeranian project and more.My favorite part of coding is CSS.(Cascading Style Sheets).My liking to coding is new and I love it. I feel so good when I start typing fast. To be a good coder I need to type even more. I must code more and study as well. I believe that one day I will become a coder.
